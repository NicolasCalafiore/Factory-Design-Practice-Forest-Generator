# Forest Generator
## What the program is about (Version Independant)
A program I developed to help me practice utilizing Factory Design. The program generates a certain number of trees, each tree a type of variety.

#### Created: Late 2022

## About Version One
 - Created Late 2022 
 - C#
 - Console App
 
 - Generates a square forest
 - Each number represents a tree
 - The center of this project was how the numbers are created with each number representing an object that was created using Factory Design aswell as Strategy
 - I'll probably slowly update this project whenever I'm bored to get a more visually appealing forest plus more diverse positioning of trees aswell as patterns (WIP)
